# Shopping Cart

## Description

A mock implementation of a shop, with focus on the shopping cart. The app was built loosely following The Odin Project's assignment (see link under 'Credits').

The app has been created using React with React Router and React Hooks including UseContext.
It is currently only a front-end app, but has been built with the intentions of future data coming from a backend database.

Styling has been done using Sass, with a display of and animations both pure CSS and triggered by JSX/React.
It is made fully mobile responsive using Flexbox.

I implemented a weather widget, that suited the theme of the rainwear shop. This was a way to show the reusability of my previously built Weather App.
